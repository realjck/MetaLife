## About

The idea for this mini-game came to me when I discovered the possibility offered by the Unity Engine (https://unity.com/) with its integration with WebGL technology. Takin into account the performance of graphics cards nowadays, a media prim texture with a 3D WebGl content in Second Life viewer is quite corrrect in terms of performance (it can vary a lot depending of the hardware, and will vary in the future).

Meta-Life must be seen as a PoC (Proof of Concept), namely the fact of being able to control an avatar via another avatar in a parent world. For the joke, it was necessary to make a reference to Second Life, hence the reproduction of mechanisms (like hitting the up key twice to run, or the sound effect accompanying the arrival on a place) , as well as the name, logo and its color.

I am currently training as a Junior Programmer on Unity, this project was an opportunity to put my knowledge into practice in the design of this mini-game. In particular, I used many assets under free license since I'm still in training and started to learn.

As the project is hosted by Github Pages, the whole project source is available at this address: https://github.com/realjck/metalife.
